It‚Äôs 2020 yet I‚Äôm baffled at why someone‚Äôs skin colour still makes a difference to how they‚Äôre treated. So many people are getting called out on here but I can understand that EVERYONE has their ways of dealing with things. Some people internalise, some people scream off the top of their lungs, some people punch things etc. I‚Äôve had a few conversations with my friends and family and it‚Äôs almost sad because am I surprised that this shit is still happening? No not really. Someone asked me how I feel about this situation and so many POC are going to absolutely hate me for saying this but in all honesty, I feel slightly relieved. 50/60/70 years ago, we didn‚Äôt have social media, or cameras on our phones. We didn‚Äôt have platforms where regular people could speak up. Where regular people like me and you can educate others and be listened to and taken seriously. The bottom of the line is, our world is still racist but I feel that the world is more awake than ever before. Back then, do you think something like this would get so much coverage? Absolutely not. I know where I came from - my last name is Thomas ffs and come on, that definitely wouldn‚Äôt have been my original surname. Am I worried to bring a child of colour into this world? Yes. But I recognise that slavery happened for 400+ years, and radical change takes a long time. It‚Äôs been such a short time being out of that. I hate that people have to suffer for change to happen, of course it breaks my heart! No one can tell me different! But also, I‚Äôm just glad that I can see way more people of all races fighting for what‚Äôs right. Anyway, on a lighter note, for those who want to learn more but don‚Äôt know where to start, add a couple of these badboys to your @netflixuk list to watch. There are way more, these are just 5 of my must watches. Please like and share! Those of y‚Äôall that have more suggestions, feel free to drop these in the comments.

I have to talk about the British criminal justice system, not least because so many non-black Brits continue to delude themselves that this is a problem ‚Äúover there‚Äù in America. Whether you are a man, woman or child, your experience going through the British criminal justice system is worse if you are black. These statistics compare individuals who are accused of the same crimes so don‚Äôt start with your ‚Äúwhat about‚Äù-ism below. It‚Äôs a distraction from the reality of racism. This is a system that plays with people‚Äôs lives and black Brits continually lose the game. I\u0026#39;ll link the source for all these numbers in my stories.

I encourage people to keep voicing their opinions and I am trying to read arguments I don‚Äôt agree with to hear other people‚Äôs sides however if I see comments that are blatantly racist I will be flagging them. If you see a racist comment that I haven‚Äôt gotten seen and flagged I ask you to do the same since that is not constructive criticism, it is just hate.

On Friday, I shared this content on Twitter after I felt the conversations online were like screaming into an echo chamber. I wanted to provide those who wanted to support and be an ally with practical tips to move forward and make a change in our society. I am still somewhat surprised and overwhelmed by the reception so please take patience with me at this time. ‚Äî For a note on who I am to those who have followed me from Twitter, my name is Mireille. I\u0026#39;m an assistant editor and I do freelance writing, PR and sensitivity reading and other bits on the side. I am extremely passionate about diversity and inclusion, and everything I have shared is not new knowledge to me. From as far back as I can remember I\u0026#39;ve been campaigning, fighting for equality and supporting and working with black owned organisations. I have worked in the diversity and inclusion space for around four years and I have been equipped with knowledge, skills etc through that work as well as through wider, intensive reading and being raised by a Jamaican mother who has a degree in Women\u0026#39;s Studies. I felt as a mixed race person who was emotionally capable despite the current situation that I could use my learned experience, skills and compassion to offer this advice to allies and anyone else who was seeking advice but didn\u0026#39;t know where to turn. This is now on my stories as a highlight so please feel free to share from there or here. ‚Äî A small reminder that this took emotional labour and POC, especially black people are not here to teach you everything. When I said ask how you can support, I meant on a personal level as a friend etc. I hope this toolkit provides you with the starter info you need but there are genuinely people more experienced than me who warrant your listening to - please go and follow @nowhitesaviors, @laylafsaad, @rachel.cargle, @ckyourprivilege, @iamrachelricketts, @thegreatunlearn, @renieddolodge, @ibramxk + a few more: @akalamusic, @katycatalyst + @roiannenedd who all have books or resources from many more years of experience. _\nA post shared by Mireille Cassandra Harper (@mireillecharper) on May 30, 2020 at 1:58pm PDT\n     View this post on Instagram        Made a resource to respond to a lot of the questions I‚Äôve been getting.

My mom grew up in a tiny dirt village outside of Seoul and learned to speak English while she was teaching me. There was no space for history lessons. My ongoing understanding of our racial dynamics comes from active learning through intentional media consumption, communal conversations, and deeeeep reflective work. I say deeeeeep because it requires a complete unlearning of what I‚Äôve been taught at home, what I learned from institutional educators, and what I picked up from mainstream media. I‚Äôm moved by the responses to my last 2 posts because it shows how much we care. How we‚Äôre collectively committed to changing ourselves so we can change the systems we live in. There‚Äôs no singular way to show up. What matters is that we do the work, but the work looks different depending on our emotional capacity, physical abilities, and personal situations.

This being said, that doesn‚Äôt mean that there aren‚Äôt ways you can build your knowledge base and be an ally to the Black community ‚Äî whatever your situation is right now. Here are just a few resources that involve little to no monetary involvement, for anyone that needs a hand. A lot of us already pay for streaming services, and can borrow books from the library, so we can leverage these services. Though I‚Äôm aware this barely scratches the surface, and you might‚Äôve heard or seen most, I also realize that the Black people in our circles aren‚Äôt responsible for keeping us non-Black people of colour and White people informed. It‚Äôs not anyone‚Äôs job but your own to hold yourself accountable. Sure, this is just one of many infographics you‚Äôve seen, but let the work you put in in your everyday life be what speaks for you. These are very basic starting points, they are nowhere close to what should be/should‚Äôve been our actions.\nA post shared by @mariaxcamille on Jun 1, 2020 at 12:01pm PDT\n     View this post on Instagram        In support of amplifying Black voices, we will not be creating or posting content during the period of June 1st - June 7th. In the meantime, we‚Äôll be providing you with some information and resources that highlight ways in which you can support the Black community during this time. We‚Äôve also created a condensed and easy-to-access page with the link in our bio. - UPDATE: We‚Äôre currently working on an updated and refined infographic to best reflect material that helps educate people with the information that is authentic and reflective of Pro Black self-education. - #BlackLivesMatter #ElevateBlackVoices #AmplifyBlackVoices\nA post shared by Ennui Collective (@ennui.collective) on May 31, 2020 at 10:19pm PDT\n     View this post on Instagram        IT‚ÄôS OUR 2nd BIRTHDAY TODAY! Our first IG post was shared 5th June 2018. We‚Äôve been going full force with your support ever since. We have a really awesome campaign we will be launching MONDAY that will share some BIG PLANS we have for year 3 of NWS and beyond. Justice in action. Black liberation in action. Period. . PLEASE SWIPE ALL THE WAY THROUGH ‚Äî-\u0026gt; . . We continue to stand in solidarity with our Black family in the United States. We see you leading the revolution \u0026amp; galvanizing the people. The African family on the Continent and in the Diaspora has to be more unified than ever for this to work on a domestic \u0026amp; international level. White supremacy has worked very strategically to divide and pin Black folks against each other for hundreds of years. From the drawing of colonial borders, to the diversion of ‚Äúwhat about Black on Black crime‚Äù, to the disconnect we can see between Africans on the Continent and those in the diaspora. All of us have been subjected to deeply anti-Black propaganda \u0026amp; we need to counter that ALWAYS. . Please do read through this list \u0026amp; share it! Please know we are well aware this list is not exhaustive or complete. We invite our Black family, wherever you are in the world, to suggest additional \u0026amp; TANGIBLE ways to put solidarity into action. Add new ones or expand on ours. . We love y‚Äôall ‚úäüèø‚úäüèø‚úäüèø We need ride or dies. We can‚Äôt afford optical or momentary allies. We need CO-CONSPIRATORS in the REVOLUTION. We are keeping this same energy until it‚Äôs actualized.

These names have pushed the limits of their time to fight for something they saw‚Äîopportunity and innovation.‚Å£ ‚Å£ As you read these names, recognize the fact that skin color should not determine capability or notoriety. Note where change still needs to be done today to allow for oneness, inclusivity, justice, love, freedom, liberation, and unity for our generations to come.‚Å£ ‚Å£ These people changed us and we are now in charge of changing those in line next. Open your capacity to listen and understand.‚Å£ ‚Å£ This is a time where we must become silent for the voices of the black community to speak.

I am not an activist, I don‚Äôt know much about politics but I am a designer. When designing we have to think about who our target audience is. Who are we designing for and why? . . This made me think about how we‚Äôve been using social media, we‚Äôve been targeting our posts towards BLACK PEOPLE. Sharing trauma and stress to BLACK PEOPLE. Ranting and screaming to more BLACK PEOPLE. . . So the question is how can we continue sharing but do it in an effective way? We have to think about our target audience (the oppressor) and where they hang out virtually. We have to use their hashtags to meet them virtually. . . Thank you so much to @clouddkenzie_ and @docangieluv for helping me to bring the idea of Virtual Protesting to life. . If you feel helpless this is a way to make some shake. My heart goes out to the people that are risking their lives in Minnesota. We may not be able to join them physically but we can join them virtually. #blacklivesmatter #blm\nA post shared by Design | Content Creator | üá±üá∑ (@sa.liine) on May 29, 2020 at 11:55am PDT\n     View this post on Instagram        #sorry #forTheBreak #BeenBusy #BeingFuriousAndSad #WhileMarching #NowForABriefReminder #ThatTheOnlyTime #WhiteSilenceIsGood #IsWhenAEuroDJ #TriesToTakeCredit #ForTheMusicTheyPlay #KnowYourHistory #GiveSomethingBack #AndFightLikeHellForIt #CheckStoryHighlights #ForCausesToDonateTo #BlackLivesMatter\nA post shared by that Guy from boiler room (@huge.dj.party.alerts) on Jun 9, 2020 at 10:25am PDT\n     View this post on Instagram        #BreonnaTaylor #SayHerName via @thefakepan\nA post shared by All Def Nation (@alldefnation) on Jun 14, 2020 at 1:04pm PDT\n     View this post on Instagram        You guys seem to love earnest celebrity videos, so here you go!

Make allies not enemies. üòò‚ô•Ô∏è‚úäüèΩ #BlackLivesMatter\nA post shared by Angelia ‚ÄúAngel‚Äù Trinidad (@angeliatrinidad) on Jun 9, 2020 at 7:47am PDT\n     View this post on Instagram        A resource to help ensure protest language and etiquette is anti-ableist and centering disabled people. Please feel free to share at will. I will be making one about inclusive resource-sharing shortly, as well. // ORANGE BACKGROUND WITH WHITE AND LIGHT-COLORED TEXT. Title slide: disability-inclusive protest etiquette: a guide. Slide 2: Remember that many disabled people will not be able to attend protests, no matter how much they want to be there. Avoid language like ‚Äújust show up,‚Äù ‚Äúthe front lines are where the real work is done,‚Äù etc. It is ableist, shaming, and unhelpful. There are many ways to be involved, such as organizing, donating, and doing daily work. Doing the work is not unique to the front lines. Slide 3: some disabled people will be attending protests alongside you. Understand that you won‚Äôt always know who they are, as many disabilities are invisible. Respect people‚Äôs space. Do not touch physically disabled people or their wheelchairs/mobility equipment. Don‚Äôt tell anyone you‚Äôre inspired by them. And this is an absolute rule: never assume someone is ‚Äúfaking it‚Äù if you see them using a mobility device one minute and not the next. Slide 4: contact protestors beforehand to ensure that events are accessible. Specific actions include: ensuring there is a rally alternative to each march, checking in about access to ramps/restrooms and interpreters, providing mobility aids and a team to assist if possible, ensuring that all organized protest language is anti-ableist. Slide 5: educate yourself - black disabled people should never be an afterthought, especially when it comes to police brutality. Disabled people make up between one third and one half of all people killed by police. This issue is CENTRAL to the black disabled community. Learn the names of black disabled victims of police violence. Advocate for measures that protect disabled people whenever you discuss deescalation techniques or alternatives to police. Remember that ALL black lives matter. If you‚Äôre not concerned with the lives of black disabled people, you are not part of the black lives matter movement. // #blacklivesmatter #disabilityawareness #ableism\nA post shared by Strength-Centered Speech (@strengthcenteredspeech) on Jun 5, 2020 at 10:52am PDT\n  "

I\u0026#39;ve been fervently exploring designers from around the world and felt it would be helpful to create a directory that highlights some of the incredible Black-owned brands from Canada. Supporting Black-owned/led/run businesses is one way to help redistribute wealth in the fight for racial and financial equality. Whether it‚Äôs by shopping, following on IG, signing up for a newsletter, engaging via comments or telling a friend, every act of support counts. This list is by no means exhaustive but includes all the designers that I\u0026#39;ve personally bookmarked \u0026amp; a few that I‚Äôve ordered from so far. Instagram wouldn‚Äôt let me tag all the brands so I‚Äôve listed them below so it‚Äôs easy to tap and follow! On the blog you‚Äôll find more information \u0026amp; a link to each shop. In my stories you can find the resources I used to discover all these designers as well as a few INTL directories \u0026amp; brands I think you‚Äôll love too. Thanks for your patience while I pulled this post together, I had quite a few DMs asking about something like this so I hope it will prove to be a helpful resource.

If you‚Äôre able, please donate to the frontlines‚Äî you can start here: https://minnesotafreedomfund.org/donate EDIT: I recognize the complexities of the concepts and histories that I mention in this short post. I encourage you to add and expand on any points I made if you wish when you share, or in the comments below. I‚Äôm also open to conversation in my DMs about the nature and categorization of settler colonial states, slavery in Canada, and any other topic that this text brings to your mind. As long as it‚Äôs respectful, I want to have these conversations. Thank you! EDIT: I‚Äôve gotten lots of messages and comments about my exclusion of nation states in South and Central America, and I was also unsure of the reason why they weren‚Äôt defined as settler colonial states in the broader political theory definition of the term ‚Äúsettler colonialism‚Äù. I did some research and found that scholars seem divided here ‚Äî sometimes nation states in these areas are used as examples of settler colonial states, and sometimes they are excluded. I want to be clear that I recognize the colonial histories of those territories, and am engaging with more material to learn about how exactly they are categorized as colonial states. If anyone has more information about why some scholars do not include the nation states in South and Central America in their writing about settler colonialism, I‚Äôd love to learn more. EDIT: Made a version of this text sharable on my personal fb. If it‚Äôs useful to you, find it there.

	"content": "   View this post on Instagram        when i first heard #defundthepolice my instinct was fear. who would i call when i was in danger? how do i know that i‚Äôll be safe? then i caught myself. that is the essence of my white privilege. for at least a quarter of the population, the police are not who you would call when there is danger. they ARE the danger. the perpetrators. they are the under-trained \u0026amp; over-armed people who could enter your apartment, murder you in your sleep, and get away with it with 0 consequences. these incidents are not isolated. they are part of a pattern of over-policing of black communities that stems from the systemic racism that is sewn into the fabric of this country. reform has been ineffective, and the baby steps we have taken might be enough to make it feel like progress, but not enough to elicit the real change that is needed. the institution is broken and needs to be abolished so we can start over completely. here is some information i found both shocking and disturbing. i am very grateful to all the good information being shared, i am learning SO MUCH, and to everyone who is making me question the broken parts of this country i have had both the luxury and tendency to overlook. #blacklivesmatter #abolishthepolice #defundthepolice #defundthepoliceinvestinthepeople *correction* i spelled dietitian wrong (my bad üòû) and also the correct hours are 1200, with 900 of those hours in professional work setting. sorry for this mix up it‚Äôs my fault. now back to the actual conversation!!\nA post shared by Emily Warren (@emilywarrennnn) on Jun 14, 2020 at 10:12am PDT\n     View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Alessandra Naccarato (@alessandra.nacc) on Jun 6, 2020 at 7:36pm PDT\n     View this post on Instagram        This guide reflects one, but not every stance on what it would mean to defund the police. Philip McHarris, a doctoral candidate in sociology at Yale University and lead research and policy associate at the Community Resource Hub for Safety and Accountability notes in a recent article that some supporters of divestment want to reallocate some, but not all, funds away from police departments to social services. Some want to strip all police funding and dissolve departments. I encourage you to research both partial divestment and abolition as you form your opinion. Look to the research the topic beyond Instagram. The concept exists on a spectrum, but both interpretations center on reimagining what public safety looks like - shifting resources away from law enforcement toward community resources. And disbanding police is a more radical reimagining than divesting. Due to the wide reach of my original 2 Part post: ‚ÄúWhy do people say Defund the Police‚Äù and the surrounding conversation, I have created this guide to common responses to the topic, and one way you can answer them. For more cited information on this topic, please read my original two part explanation.\nA post shared by Audrey (@audreyeaden) on Jun 11, 2020 at 9:58am PDT\n     View this post on Instagram        for anyone who thinks ‚Äúdefunding the police‚Äù means to get rid of law enforcement entirely like no girl that‚Äôs not what i* said!! cops don‚Äôt need all that money.. like.. for what.. if we redistribute the funds to other, more important places, i think the need for cops overall will be much less edit* defunding to abolish the system at hand YES but what i‚Äôm saying is at the end of the day. people will need someone to call when they are in danger. We don‚Äôt have to call them police but i think it should be people from the community who are PROPERLY trained, screened for mental health/racial bias, and equipped to deal with a specific situation at hand. Tear down/abolish the fucked system now to rebuild a new, better one. this is my opinion.\nA post shared by :..::.:.:jazZeLLe::.::.:.
